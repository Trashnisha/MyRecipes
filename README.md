The Chocolate Chip Cookie is America's most famous cookie. It was invented in 1930 by Ruth Wakefield, who was the owner of the Toll House Inn in Massachusetts. The story goes that one day she decided to add small chunks of a Nestle's Semisweet Yellow Label Chocolate bar to her cookie dough. The 'chocolate chip' cookies were an instant hit with her customers. Word must have spread of how good these cookies were, because by 1939 Nestle was selling small chocolate morsels (or chips) in a yellow bag. Nestle went on to buy the rights to the Toll House name and to Ruth Wakefield's 'chocolate chip' cookie recipe. They called her recipe "The Famous Toll House Cookie" and printed it on the back of their Yellow bag of chocolate chips.
